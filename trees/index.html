    <p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Many times we required to have more than two paths froms data object (non-linear) when
            we have to represent one or moeny relationship. The best way is to use non-linear data structure.</span></p>
    <p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Tree is a non-linear data structure. Non-linear&nbsp; data structures are capable of
                expressin more complex relationship than linear data structure. In general, where ever the hierarchical
                relationship amon data is to be preserved tree is used.</span><br /></span></p>
    <p><span><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Today in this article we are going to implement a basic Binary Search Tree. But
                    before that lets see a binary tree.</span></span></span></p>
    <p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; What is a Binary Tree?</span><br /></span></span></span></p>
    <p><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>Binary Tree is a special form of a tree is finite
                    set of nodes, which is either empty or partitioned into three sets, one which is the root and two
                    disjoint binary trees called left subtree and right subtree. It si a tree where every node can have
                    at most two branches(children).</span></span></span></p>
    <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Now lets implement Binary Search Tree in Javascript.</span><br /></p>
